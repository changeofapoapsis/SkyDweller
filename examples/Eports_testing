Compiling and Testing

Compile and Upload STM32 Code:

Compile and upload the code to the STM32 microcontroller using a compatible IDE (e.g., STM32CubeIDE).
Ensure the sensor is properly connected to the STM32 and check UART data transmission with an oscilloscope if available.

Compile and Upload DJI PSDK Code:
Compile the DJI Payload SDK code on the DJI droneâ€™s onboard computer or payload module.
Testing the Integration:
Power up the DJI drone and STM32 microcontroller.
Monitor the DJI PSDK output to confirm it receives and logs the distance data from the STM32.

4. Troubleshooting
No Data on DJI Side:
Check that the STM32 and E-Port UARTs are configured at the same baud rate (9600).
Verify wiring between STM32 TX and E-Port RX pins.

Incorrect Readings:
Ensure correct parsing of distance data in both STM32 and DJI PSDK code.
Check for stable sensor power connections to prevent noise in readings.

Data Lag:
If there is data lag, reduce HAL_Delay() in the STM32 main loop to increase the frequency of data updates.
