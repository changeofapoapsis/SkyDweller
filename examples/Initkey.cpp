Explanation of the Code

Initialization Example: The init_ultrasonic_example.cpp file sets up the payload and initializes the ultrasonic sensor. 
  
Replace initializeUltrasonicSensor() with actual sensor setup logic (e.g., GPIO configuration).
  
Reading Data Example: The read_ultrasonic_example.cpp file reads distance data from the ultrasonic sensor in a loop. The pseudo-function readUltrasonicSensor() simulates the sensorâ€™s distance reading in centimeters.
  
Sending Data Example: In send_ultrasonic_data_example.cpp, data from the ultrasonic sensor is sent to the drone. The distance data is read, converted to a byte array, and transmitted using the SendData() method of the payload. 

This example logs both the reading and the sending result.

These examples should help users set up, test, and send ultrasonic sensor data to the DJI drone. 

Be sure to replace pseudo-code with the actual library or SDK functions for the specific ultrasonic sensor being used.
