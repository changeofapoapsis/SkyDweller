# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers common issues and solutions for custom payload integration.

## Common Issues

### Payload Not Recognized

- **Solution**: Ensure the payload is securely connected and powered. Check for loose connections and confirm that the ports used are compatible with the DJI PSDK.

### Data Transmission Issues

- **Solution**: Verify that the `SendData` and `ReceiveData` functions are implemented correctly. Use logging statements to check data flow.

### SDK Initialization Errors

- **Solution**: Confirm that the DJI PSDK is configured with the correct App Key and that all required dependencies are installed. Revisit the installation steps to ensure everything is set up properly.
