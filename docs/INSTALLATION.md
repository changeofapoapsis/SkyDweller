# Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up the development environment for integrating a custom payload using the DJI Payload SDK (PSDK).

## Prerequisites

- DJI drone compatible with the PSDK (e.g., Matrice series)
- Computer running Linux or Windows
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Visual Studio)
- DJI PSDK libraries installed

## Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dji-psdk-integration.git
   cd dji-psdk-integration


Install DJI PSDK: Follow the instructions in the DJI Developer Portal to download and install the PSDK.

Install Dependencies

**Install CMake**:

   sudo apt-get install cmake

Additional dependencies may be required based on your system. Follow DJI’s setup documentation for details.

Build Example Code:

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

You’re now ready to proceed to the hardware setup and configuration.

# Hardware Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions for connecting the custom payload hardware to the DJI drone.

## Step 1: Connect the Payload

1. **Identify Payload Ports**: Locate the compatible ports on the DJI drone for payload integration, typically a UART or CAN port.
2. **Connect Power**: Ensure your payload is powered correctly. DJI drones usually provide a power supply, but verify the voltage and current requirements of your payload.

## Step 2: Verify Connection

After connecting the hardware, verify the connections:
- Ensure all connections are secure and shielded if necessary.
- Power on the drone to check if the payload is recognized. 

Refer to your payload hardware documentation for further details on connection requirements.
