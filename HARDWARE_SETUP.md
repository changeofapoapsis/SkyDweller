# Hardware Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions for connecting the custom payload hardware to the DJI drone.

## Step 1: Connect the Payload

1. **Identify Payload Ports**: Locate the compatible ports on the DJI drone for payload integration, typically a UART or CAN port.
2. **Connect Power**: Ensure your payload is powered correctly. DJI drones usually provide a power supply, but verify the voltage and current requirements of your payload.

## Step 2: Verify Connection

After connecting the hardware, verify the connections:
- Ensure all connections are secure and shielded if necessary.
- Power on the drone to check if the payload is recognized. 

Refer to your payload hardware documentation for further details on connection requirements.
